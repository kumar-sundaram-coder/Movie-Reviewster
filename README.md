<h1>Movie Reviewster</h1>
<p>
This is a platform where you can search for movies and find their
reviews before watching those movies, so that your time won't be
wasted and you can pick the best movie to watch next. After watching
any movie, you could also add your reviews to the website. With the
help of machine learning and deep learning your review would be
automatically classified as positive or negative. And then
accordingly the previous rating of that particular movie would be
changed after your review.Your review plays an important role in
deciding the rating of a movie, so go to the add review page and add
a review now. This will help others to know how was the movie before
actually watching that movie.

<h3>How is it acheived!!</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Taken a large dataset and then after
preprocessing, trained the models of Machine learning :- Bernoulli
Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes and one model of Deep
learning :- Artificial Neural Network
</li>
<li>
Then compare the result of three models and used the best one at the
backend for classification of reviews.
</li>
<li>
Now we used HTML, CSS and JavaScript
for the frontend.
</li>
<li>
Then using Flask we have integrated our best ML/DL model with the
frontend.
</li>
<li>
After setting the database with MongoDB and pyMongo we were able to
get this awesome fully functional platform.
</li>
</ul>
