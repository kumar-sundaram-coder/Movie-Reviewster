# Movie-Reviewster
This is a platform where you can search for movies and find their reviews before watching those movies, so that your time won't be wasted and you can pick the best movie to watch next. After watching any movie, you could also add your reviews to the website. With the help of machine learning and deep learning your review would be automatically classified as positive or negative. And then accordingly the previous rating of that particular movie would be changed after your review.Your review plays an important role in deciding the rating of a movie, so go to the add review page and add a review now. This will help others to know how was the movie before actually watching that movie.

How is it acheived!!
Taken a large dataset and then after preprocessing, trained the models of Machine learning :- Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes and one model of Deep learning :- Artificial Neural Network
Then compare the result of three models and used the best one at the backend for classification of reviews.
Now we used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend.
Then using Flask we have integrated our best ML/DL model with the frontend.
After setting the database with MongoDB and pyMongo we were able to get this awesome fully functional platform.
